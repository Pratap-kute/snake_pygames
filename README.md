       - `reset` resets the snake's position and direction (e.g., for game restarts).
   - **FRUIT Class**
     - **Constructor (`__init__`)**
       - **Purpose:**
         - Initializes the fruit with a random position and loads its image asset.
       - **Key Lines:**
         - `self.randomize()`: Calls the `randomize` function to set a random position.
         - `apple = pygame.image.load("graphics/apple.png").convert_alpha()`: Loads the apple image.
       - **Why:**
         - Creates the target for the snake, adding an element of randomness and visual representation.
     - **`draw_fruit` Function**
       - **Purpose:**
         - Draws the fruit on the screen at its current position.
       - **Key Lines:**
         - `fruit_rect = pygame.Rect( ... )`: Creates a rectangle representing the fruit's position and size.
         - `screen.blit(apple, fruit_rect)`: Draws the apple image onto the rectangle.
       - **Why:**
         - Visualizes the fruit on the screen, making it clear where the snake needs to go.
     - **`randomize` Function**
       - **Purpose:**
         - Moves the fruit to a new random position within the grid.
       - **Key Lines:**
         - `self.x = random.randint(0, cell_number - 1)`: Randomly chooses an X-coordinate.

## Introduction

This Python code for a classic Snake game, providing detailed descriptions of each function, class, and gameplay mechanic.

## Project Setup

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (install with `pip install pygame`)

**Running the Game:**

1. Save the code as `snake.py`.
2. Open a terminal in the same directory.
3. Run the game using `python snake.py`.

## Game Objects

### SNAKE Class

- Represents the snake in the game.
- `__init__` initializes:
  - `body`: Initial snake segments and direction.
  - `new_block`: Flag for adding a new block after fruit consumption.
  - Snake head and tail image assets.
  - Snake body image assets for various orientations.
  - Sound effect for fruit consumption.
- `draw_snake` draws the snake on the screen based on its `body` and updates head/tail graphics.
  - `update_head_graphics` and `update_tail_graphics` handle dynamic head/tail image selection based on direction.
- `move_snake` updates the snake's position by modifying its `body` list.
- `add_block` adds a new block to the snake's tail upon fruit consumption.
- `play_crunch_sound` plays the sound effect when the snake eats fruit.
- `reset` resets the snake's position and direction.

### FRUIT Class

- Represents the fruit that the snake eats.
- `__init__` initializes:
  - Randomizes the initial `position` of the fruit within the game grid.
  - Loads the fruit image asset.
- `draw_fruit` draws the fruit on the screen at its current `position`.
- `randomize` moves the fruit to a new random position within the grid.

### MAIN Class

- Manages the overall game logic and interaction.
- `__init__` creates instances of the `SNAKE` and `FRUIT` classes.
- `update` handles game updates:
  - Calls `move_snake` to update the snake's position.
  - Calls `check_collision` to check for fruit and snake collisions.
  - Calls `check_fail` to check for game-over conditions.
- `draw_elements` draws the game elements:
  - Calls `draw_grass` to draw the background grass.
  - Calls `draw_fruit` to draw the fruit.
  - Calls `draw_snake` to draw the snake.
  - Calls `draw_score` to draw the current score.
- `check_collision` handles both fruit and snake collision scenarios:
  - Upon fruit collision:
    - Calls `randomize` to move the fruit.
    - Calls `add_block` to grow

## Deep Dive into Challenging Game Logic

### 5.1 Managing Snake Body Segments

- **Movement and Growth:**
  - Each segment's position relies on the **previous** segment, creating a "follow-the-leader" system.
  - When moving, the head segment updates first based on the direction, then all others follow suit.
  - Growth after fruit consumption adds a new segment at the head, extending the snake smoothly.
- **Visual Representation:**
  - Segments need dynamic graphics based on their relative positions.
  - Straight segments, corner segments, and tail require different images for a realistic look.
  - Conditional logic checks neighboring segments to determine the correct image for each.

### 5.2 Efficient Collision Detection

- **Fruit Consumption:**
  - Checking if the snake's head overlaps with the fruit's position indicates consumption.
- **Self-Collision:**
  - Iterating through body segments and comparing their positions with the head's position is necessary.
  - Any overlap signifies a collision, leading to game over.

### 5.3 Optimizations and Trade-offs

- **Performance:**
  - Collision detection can be computationally expensive. Consider optimizing by:
    - Using more efficient data structures (e.g., spatial partitions) for faster lookups.
    - Minimizing unnecessary comparisons.
  - Balance performance with accuracy; don't compromise core mechanics.
- **Visual Fidelity:**
  - More image assets for smoother corner transitions can enhance appearance.
  - Balancing this with performance and memory overhead is crucial.
